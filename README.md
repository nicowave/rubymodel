# rubymodel
A collection of Ruby tutorial programs that are helping me learn Ruby and concurrently how to build a Ruby On Rails app with teamtreehouse.com (The Ruby track builds into the Ruby On Rails track). Eventually, slowly but surely, this Rails app will serve as a model for the data structure and app at the heart of http://artistreeapp.com (coming soon to a browser you use) :)
